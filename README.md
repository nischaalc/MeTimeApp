# MeTime
This app is the final deliverable of an Android App Design class taken at Drexel University. 
Collaborators on this project were [Cameron Spencer](https://github.com/chuckle123) and [Roger White](https://github.com/RogerThat427) who wrote the Android app while I focused on the website and server required by the app. 

Some code may still be undocumented or inefficient due to time constraints in completing this project.
